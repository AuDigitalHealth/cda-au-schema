## FHIR Logical Models for CDA with Australian schema

The `input` directory contains FHIR artifacts representing the core CDA logic models with Australian extensions and adapted classes (in StructureDefinition resources).

It is an adaptation of the [HL7 International CDA Logical Model Specification](https://hl7.org/cda/stds/core/2.0.0-sd-snapshot1/) with specific modifications and inclusions to represent the CDA schema including Australian CDA extensions using the FHIR StructureDefinition framework.

## CDA Schema

The original (normative) schema and update schema with extensions is maintained at https://github.com/HL7/CDA-core-sd/.
