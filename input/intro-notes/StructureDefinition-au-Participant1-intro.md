### ParticipationType Value Set
 
The terminology binding on the au-Participant1 `@typeCode` attribute has been changed to use the [v3-ParticipationType valueSet](http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ParticipationType) rather than the valueSet as used in [HL7 International CDA Participant1 class](https://hl7.org/cda/stds/core/2.0.0-sd-snapshot1/StructureDefinition-Participant1.html). This is due to the attribute value of `PART`, which is mandated in many of the My Health Record CDA implementations.
